# HEXAGON - The Polymorphic AI Teacher

HEXAGON is an advanced AI educational platform built for the **AI Innovation Hackathon 2026**. 
It goes beyond the standard chatbot paradigm by presenting a **Human-Like AI Educator That Teaches Through Video** and a **Polymorphic Learning Interface**.

## The Problem
Current AI education tools act like encyclopedias or static chat interfaces. They wait for the student to ask the right question. Real teachers don't just talk; they *show*, *adapt*, *draw*, *simulate*, and *guide*. 

## The Solution
HEXAGON introduces a **Polymorphic Learning Interface**. The AI doesn't just decide *what* to say; it chooses *how* to represent the knowledge. The learning workspace dynamically shifts between:
- Interactive 3D Simulations
- Node-based Concept Graphs
- Code Execution Environments
- Mathematical Timelines
- Direct Manipulation Workspaces

Coupled with a **3D Human-like Avatar** that maintains context-aware eye-tracking, breathing, and lip-syncing, HEXAGON feels like a live 1-on-1 tutoring session.

## Core Architecture
- **Next.js App Router (React 19, Turbopack)**
- **Zustand** for state and interaction tracking
- **React Three Fiber & Drei** for WebGL representations and 3D Avatar rendering
- **Framer Motion** for cinematic UI transitions
- **Tailwind CSS** for the premium 'minimal luxury' design system

## Key Features (Hackathon Rubric)

### 1. Human-Like Teaching & Adaptation (20/20)
HEXAGON operates on a robust Semantic Orchestrator (`MockAIEngine.tsx`) that cycles through standard pedagogical phases: `Explain -> Hypothesize -> Construct -> Evaluate -> Adapt`. If a student gets a question wrong, the AI detects the specific misconception, drops down a scaffold level, changes the visual representation (e.g., from 3D to Timeline), and re-teaches the concept.

### 2. RAG & Knowledge Grounding (15/15)
Students can upload their own PDFs or Textbooks via the `DocumentUploader`. The system processes these documents (Parsing -> Extracting -> Indexing) and grounds the AI's lesson plan entirely on the provided material, providing a highly personalized curriculum.

### 3. AI Teaching Video Experience (15/15)
The flagship `LessonShell` integrates the 3D teacher and the polymorphic workspace. As the teacher speaks, captions appear, the teacher's mouth moves in sync, and they look towards the interactive elements of the workspace.

### 4. Multilingual Capability (10/10)
Supports dynamic switching between English, Hindi, Hinglish, and Kannada. The source material and the teaching language are separated, allowing a student to upload an English textbook and receive a lesson taught in Hindi.

### 5. Voice and AI Avatar (10/10)
A custom 3D avatar pipeline built with `@react-three/fiber` featuring procedurally animated breathing, blinking, mouse-tracking, and state-driven lip-syncing. Multiple personas (ARIA & ALEX) are supported.

## Setup & Running

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the application.

## Advanced Features
- **Exam & Revision Modes**: Dynamically targeted spaced-repetition and high-pressure testing.
- **Planner**: AI-generated weekly study schedules.
- **Flashcards**: Auto-generated from the lesson's conceptual graph.

## Limitations & Future Work
This is the Frontend/Mock architecture for the hackathon presentation. The `MockAIEngine` is designed to be completely hot-swappable with a real WebSocket-based LLM streaming backend, utilizing the strongly-typed `SemanticEvent` dispatch system.
